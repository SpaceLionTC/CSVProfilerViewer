Using
--

Click on A measurement circle to add it as the rightmost frame in the analysis tables below. Clicking another frame moves the right column to the left one and adds the data to the right column.

Recommended best practice...

 - First click a good frame with low frametime
 - Then click a bad frame with high frametime.
 - Click the various tabs to compare different data. Click column headers to sort.
 - The default is to sort descending on the rightmost frame column. This way you will see expensive things at the top, and compare them with their counterpart in the leftmost column.

The framerate chart will show the distribtion of the _framerate_, not frame time. This is a convenient way to see if the majority of the frames "behave".

This can serve as a good pointer to where to start to look for things that are expensive!

Enjoy!
